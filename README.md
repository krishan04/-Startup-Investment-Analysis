# Startup Investment Analysis

This project aims to assist in selecting the best location for establishing a startup and identifying potential investors likely to fund the venture. The analysis focuses on three key locations in India: Bangalore, Mumbai, and NCR (including Gurgaon, Noida, and New Delhi). The project involves multiple stages of data analysis to derive meaningful insights and recommendations.

## Objectives

1. Determine the location with the highest number of startup funding events.
2. Identify the top 5 investors who have invested the maximum number of times.
3. Refine the list by identifying the top 5 investors who have invested in different companies the maximum number of times.
4. Further refine the list based on specific investment types: Seed Funding and Crowdfunding for early-stage startups, and Private Equity for growth-stage startups.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Load the dataset and handle missing values.
   - Standardize city names to account for case sensitivity and spelling variations.
   - Correct spelling mistakes in startup names and investment types.
